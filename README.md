## Introduction

Welcome to Dankest Dungeon! This is an early-stage text-based adventure game inspired by the renowned Darkest Dungeon. Immerse yourself in a captivating narrative and make strategic choices as you navigate through the evolving storyline.

## Game Overview

Dankest Dungeon is a text-based adventure game that focuses on storytelling and decision-making. Here's what you can experience in the current version:


- **Interactive Text:** Interact with the game through text-based prompts and choose your path as you encounter various scenarios and challenges.

- **Early Development:** Please note that Dankest Dungeon is in the early stages of development, and gameplay may be limited in this version. Honestly, if I work on this project again I'll make it from the ground up once again (like a phoenix from the ashes or some other reincarnation metaphor).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run in your IDE of choice.
